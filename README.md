## 🎯 About

This project is part of a collaborative learning initiative developed by Group 8 during Sprint 2 of Batch 19. The project demonstrates the implementation of Java applications with comprehensive testing using Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) practices.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Java** (80.4%) - Core application development
- **Gherkin** (19.6%) - BDD test scenarios
- **Cucumber** - BDD testing framework
- **JUnit** - Unit testing framework
- **Maven/Gradle** - Build automation (assumed)

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Maven 3.6+ or Gradle 6.0+
- IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code)
- Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RK2203/Sprint2batch19Group8.git
   cd Sprint2batch19Group8
   ```

2. **Build the project**
   
   For Maven:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```
   
   For Gradle:
   ```bash
   gradle build
   ```

3. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   java -jar target/Sprint2batch19Group8-1.0.jar
   ```

## 🧪 Running Tests

This project includes comprehensive test suites using Cucumber for BDD testing.

### Run all tests
```bash
mvn test
```

### Run Cucumber tests specifically
```bash
mvn test -Dtest=CucumberTestRunner
```

### Generate test reports
```bash
mvn surefire-report:report
```

## 📈 Development Workflow

1. **Feature Development**: Create feature branches from main
2. **BDD Approach**: Write Gherkin scenarios before implementation
3. **Code Implementation**: Develop Java code to satisfy BDD scenarios
4. **Testing**: Ensure all Cucumber tests pass
5. **Code Review**: Peer review before merging
6. **Integration**: Merge to main branch

## 🔧 Configuration
